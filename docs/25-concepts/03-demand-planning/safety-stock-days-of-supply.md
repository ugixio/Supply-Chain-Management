# Safety Stock — Days of Supply (CPT-0012)

> The simplest buffer: hold *n* days of average demand. No statistics, no service-level
> target — a planner's rule of thumb.

## Formula — two different ones

**Two different formulas share this name.** Both are legitimate; they answer different questions,
and a project must say which it means:

    (a) chosen cover:      ss = D̄ · cover_days
    (b) lead-time spread:  ss = D̄ · (LT_max − LT_avg)

| Symbol | Meaning | Unit |
|---|---|---|
| D̄ | Average daily demand | units/day |
| cover_days | days of demand the buffer is meant to cover — **project-chosen** | days |
| LT_max, LT_avg | maximum and average lead time, when the cover is derived from lead-time spread | days |

Form **(a)** buffers against a **freely chosen** number of days — the planner's judgement, and it
never collapses to zero. Form **(b)** buffers against **lead-time overrun only** — its cover is
derived rather than chosen, which makes it defensible, but it goes to **zero** when lead time is
perfectly stable, leaving no buffer for demand variability at all. The two are not
interchangeable, and reporting one under the other's name is how a buffer silently disappears.

## Inputs and outputs

- **Inputs:** average daily demand, plus the cover — either stated directly as a number of days
  or derived from the lead-time spread `LT_max − LT_avg`. **These are two different definitions
  sharing one name**, and a project must say which it means: a flat day count is a planner's
  judgement, while the lead-time spread ties the buffer to observed supply variability.
- **Output:** a quantity in units. Rounding up to an orderable quantity happens at the ordering
  boundary, not inside the formula.
- Neither guards against negative inputs; the Python form returns a **negative** buffer if
  `max_lead_time < avg_lead_time`, which is nonsensical but unrejected.

## Assumptions and limits

- Ignores demand variability entirely — two SKUs with the same mean and wildly different
  volatility get the same buffer.
- Cheap to explain and to govern, which is why it survives in practice for C-class items
  where the cost of being wrong is low.
- **Does not apply when:** demand is volatile or a service-level target must be met — use
  CPT-0014, or CPT-0015 when lead time also varies.

## Worked example

D̄ = 50 units/day, LT_avg = 7 days, LT_max = 10 days, planner cover = 5 days:

- stated cover of 5 days: ss = 50 × 5 = **250 units**
- cover derived from lead-time spread (max 10, avg 7): ss = 50 × 3 = **150 units**

Same demand, same SKU, two definitions — which is why the node insists the project say which
one it means.

Same SKU, same data, two different buffers — because they are two different methods.

## Governing rules

- **INV-R5** — a physical balance cannot be negative; safety stock is
  the buffer that makes this affordable.
